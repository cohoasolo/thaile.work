                <blockquote>
                    <p>Sleep is such an essential pattern of life since it is so apparent. Yet, few people understand that sleep is a state feature - a space that crosses one's life's 
                    midpoints and very plainly reflects self-shape.
                    Giấc, in dialogue with each being, conceives as a modest exhibition of boxes, the manifestation of those nights of sleep. Here, individuals are able to touch the 
                    parallels and variances, the subtleties, and the ambiguity in each unique tale through our boxes.

                <h2>Personal thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                The sleep stories were collected from interviews with people in our lives who were willing to share their experiences with us. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, 
                as we rarely have the opportunity to talk about someone else's personal time, especially when it comes to sleep. It was fascinating to see how different people have 
                unique sleep rituals and patterns. We learned that our sleep stories could reveal a lot about our personalities and lives. Knowing about the sleep habits of others 
                was eye-opening, and it made us feel empathy towards them. The maker of each box, as well as the viewers, had different visual interpretations of each sleep story. 
                That's why we decided to work on one box independently. Within the time frame of the program, we were only able to make one box each, so there were only four boxes 
                representing four stories at the time of presentation. However, the project did not stop there.
                </p>
                <p>
                Through Giấc, we hope to bring attention to the beauty and uniqueness of each person's sleep story, and to spark conversations about the importance of self-care and 
                sleep hygiene.
                </p>
                <p>
                Because the output of Giấc was physical, it provided an ideal playground for me to test different mediums. Visualizing abstract experiences, such as sleep rituals, 
                was challenging, but through the process, I had fun learning about materials and craft techniques. Without a doubt, this project is a great opportunity, and I will 
                continue to experiment with more boxes.

                    I started with digital sketches of the box. Relating to the sleep story, Kén would have 3 layers of box inside one another and it would open to both sides. In the 
                    innermost layer, there would be a sphere.

                <h3>Phase 1: Preparation of each component:</h3>
                <p>
                    The acrylic box represents the present time, specifically her apartment in Saigon. To create the structure of the box, I designed the dieline on my computer and 
                    then had it laser-cut on a 3mm acrylic sheet (fig 1.1). I wanted the pieces to have a rigid bond, so I made those zigzag joints and later attached them with super 
                    glue (although I regretted using it). I tested whether I had the zigzag joints correct, and they fit perfectly (fig 1.2). 	I wanted to add a yellow overlay color 
                    over the box to replicate the sleeping lamp during her sleep. At first, I thought of buying transparent colored acrylic sheets, but they were a lot more expensive 
                    than the clear ones, so I searched for an alternative solution. Car light cover stickers turned out to be the problem solver. I cut the stickers to the size of each 
                    piece and then stuck them to the inner face of the box. I added layers of orange stickers over the yellow one to mock the light spread (the closer to the center of 
                    the light, the brighter) (fig 1.3-1.5, 1.7-1.8). For better handling, I then glued the box together while still having the protective sheet and sanded down the sharp 
                    edges (fig 1.6). 2 sides of the box were connected using 3 removable clear plastic hinges (fig 1.7-1.8).
